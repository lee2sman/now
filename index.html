<p>I’m a professor of New Media and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/profiles/2060-lee-tusman">Purchase College</a>. I am working on developing tools for DIY arts organizations and assisting in archiving, oral history, photogrammetry and other projects. See <a href="https://leetusman.com/archiving-artist-spaces">ongoing project notes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="code-sketching">Code sketching</h3>
<p>For the past 3 1/2 years I’ve engaged in <a href="https://leetusman.com/everyday/">code sketching</a>. Almost every day I work on my projects. Like a painter in their studio I work on these sequentially, trying new things, iterating on past projects, or striking into new territory. Most often these are web-based artworks, but also archives, tools, zines, games, art fragments or other experiments. Some of these grow into larger projects and others stay as small sketches.</p>

<h2 id="july-2021">July 2021</h2>
<p>Built <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile">bookmobile</a> to download articles from the web, run them through readability (removes ads, sidebars, etc), then save as cleaned minimal html, markdown and epub files. The goal is to make it easy to create a personal archive of articles and other things from the web, and outside the confines of the commercial services of products like Pocket. I have a 10 year old ebook reader (Nook Simple Touch) and this quickly converts articles and books for easy reading on my e-reader.</p>
<p>Built <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gemstats">gemstats</a> for <a href="https://ctrl-c.club/">Ctrl-C Club</a> tilde and it’s already in use! It gives very basic statistics for readers of one’s personal gemlog as well as our tilde community as a whole. As of today we’ve had over 150k readers.</p>
<p>Built <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/vwscratchpad">vwscratchpad</a>, a minimal scratchpad tool to launch from within Vim / Neovim editor when you need a quick scratchpad. Also runs in browser so I use it as a phone/tablet sketching tool.</p>
<p>Built <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/minilog">minilog</a>, a tiny CLI journaling program intended for shorter notes on what I’m doing, to look back in future years. It’s a very simple fish shell script.</p>
<h2 id="june-2021">June 2021</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Brion Gysin let the mice in; Taper #6 lets the dice out. This issue offers 26 computational poems engaging with chance and the number six, many of which pay tribute to Un coup de dés.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also continuing work on new Artists and Hackers episodes and the Space project collabo, both detailed below.</p>

<p><a href="https://notapipe.itch.io/gobi">Gobi</a> is a minimal desert adventure game in the lineage of early strategy games like The Oregon Trail. It is based on my memories of a shareware game I used to play on my Mac System 7 in the mid-90s, a game that came on a CD-Rom with 100 other games. *<a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gobi">additional info/code</a></p>
<p><a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/dungeon-of-the-day">Dungeon of the Day</a> / Embarassed Cake Watering Hole <em>(working title)</em> is an (incomplete) entry to the 7drl / seven day roguelike challenge 2021 and still in progress: <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/dungeon-of-the-day">devlog</a></p>

<h2 id="january-2021">January 2021</h2>
<h3 id="obscure-instructions-motd">Obscure Instructions MOTD</h3>
<p>In the spring I created a web-based Obscure Instructions program, an homage to Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno / Peter Schmidt. <a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/obscure-instructions-motd">Obscure Instructions MOTD</a> is a command line “Message of the Day” node program to display one randomly as a “welcome” message.</p>
<h3 id="leesd-dream-emulator">LeeSD Dream Emulator</h3>
<p>Started coding generative sketches of my dreams. An homage to LSD Dream Emulator, which I’m waiting to actually try playing until after I code my own.

<h3 id="exquisitecorp-generative-music-systems">ExquisiteCorp: generative music systems</h3>
<p>I’ve created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing Machines in. So far it’s resulted in a number of <a href="https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/">albums</a> on Bandcamp but I hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I wrote a <a href="https://leetusman.com/nosebook/programing-patching">post</a> on my Nosebook about it.</p>
