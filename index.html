<p>Co-organized workshop <a

Aarhus and CANTINA collective. Part of the Flux Factory residency at <a

Public</a> in Denmark. Produced a <a

<p>Created some small software for the <a
href="https://ctrl-c.club/">Ctrl-C Club</a> tilde group.</p>
<h2 id="july-2021">July 2021</h2>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile">bookmobile</a> to
download articles from the web, run them through readability (removes
ads, sidebars, etc), then save as cleaned minimal html, markdown and
epub files. The goal is to make it easy to create a personal archive of
articles and other things from the web, and outside the confines of the
commercial services of products like Pocket. I have a 10 year old ebook
reader (Nook Simple Touch) and this quickly converts articles and books
for easy reading on my e-reader.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gemstats">gemstats</a> for <a
href="https://ctrl-c.club/">Ctrl-C Club</a> tilde and it’s already in
use! It gives very basic statistics for readers of one’s personal gemlog
as well as our tilde community as a whole. As of today we’ve had over
150k readers.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/vwscratchpad">vwscratchpad</a>,
a minimal scratchpad tool to launch from within Vim / Neovim editor when
you need a quick scratchpad. Also runs in browser so I use it as a
phone/tablet sketching tool.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/minilog">minilog</a>, a tiny
CLI journaling program intended for shorter notes on what I’m doing, to
look back in future years. It’s a very simple fish shell script.</p>
<h2 id="june-2021">June 2021</h2>
<p><a href="https://taper.badquar.to/6/throw_of_the_text.html">A Throw
of the Text</a> is in the current edition of Taper, the online literary
magazine for small computational pieces, published by Bad Quarto. “Each
of the poems in Taper #6 is licensed as free software for you to use,
study, modify, and share however you like.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brion Gysin let the mice in; Taper #6 lets the dice out. This issue
offers 26 computational poems engaging with chance and the number six,
many of which pay tribute to Un coup de dés.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also continuing work on new Artists and Hackers episodes and the
Space project collabo, both detailed below.</p>
<h2 id="may-2021">May 2021</h2>
<p>Working on a digital archive, oral history and zine-making software

is an album of generated music created on modular synth and code (monome
teletype), inspired by a 1970s Triadex Muse machine and the first chat
bot I ever interacted with (Alfie) on a public MUSH on the internet in
the mid 90s. <em><a

<p><a href="https://notapipe.itch.io/gobi">Gobi</a> is a minimal desert
adventure game in the lineage of early strategy games like The Oregon

other games. *<a

p5.js. It includes a retro mode and onscreen console log of the input
file.</p>

<p>I’ve created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music
creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing
Machines in. So far it’s resulted in a number of <a
href="https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/">albums</a> on Bandcamp but I
hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I
wrote a <a
