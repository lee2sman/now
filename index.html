			ExquisiteCorp: generative music systems
		</h3>
		<p>
			I've created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music
			creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing
			Machines in. So far it's resulted in a number of
			<a href="https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/">albums</a> on Bandcamp but I
			hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I wrote
			a <a href="https://leetusman.com/nosebook/programing-patching">post</a> on
			my Nosebook about it.

			<a href="https://www.babycastles.com">Babycastles</a> is a 10+ year NYC
			based collective fostering and amplifying diverse voices in videogame
			culture. We have an art space in Union Square, Manhattan, and are active
			online. I'm part of the organizing collective that helps run the space and
			puts together public programs. I currently organize the Babycastles
			Academy workshops: low-cost or free online workshops on a variety of
			topics of interest to our community. We've held 25+ workshops so far since
			the start of the pandemic. Topics: livecoding, game design, goal-setting,
			writing grants, protester safety, and more.

			Started coding generative sketches of my dreams. An homage to LSD Dream
