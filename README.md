Created some small software for the [Ctrl-C Club](https://ctrl-c.club/) tilde group.

## July 2021

Built [bookmobile](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile) to download articles from the web, run them through readability (removes ads, sidebars, etc), then save as cleaned minimal html, markdown and epub files. The goal is to make it easy to create a personal archive of articles and other things from the web, and outside the confines of the commercial services of products like Pocket. I have a 10 year old ebook reader (Nook Simple Touch) and this quickly converts articles and books for easy reading on my e-reader.

Built [gemstats](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gemstats) for [Ctrl-C Club](https://ctrl-c.club/) tilde and it's already in use! It gives very basic statistics for readers of one's personal gemlog as well as our tilde community as a whole. As of today we've had over 150k readers.

Built [vwscratchpad](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/vwscratchpad), a minimal scratchpad tool to launch from within Vim / Neovim editor when you need a quick scratchpad. Also runs in browser so I use it as a phone/tablet sketching tool.

Built [minilog](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/minilog), a tiny CLI journaling program intended for shorter notes on what I'm doing, to look back in future years. It's a very simple fish shell script.

## June 2021

[A Throw of the Text](https://taper.badquar.to/6/throw_of_the_text.html) is in the current edition of Taper, the online literary magazine for small computational pieces, published by Bad Quarto. "Each of the poems in Taper #6 is licensed as free software for you to use, study, modify, and share however you like."

> Brion Gysin let the mice in; Taper #6 lets the dice out. This issue offers 26 computational poems engaging with chance and the number six, many of which pay tribute to Un coup de dés.

I am also continuing work on new Artists and Hackers episodes and the Space project collabo, both detailed below.

## May 2021

Working on a digital archive, oral history and zine-making software collaboratively with [Space 1026](https://space1026.com/) in Philadelphia. A project while at NEW INC, with support from Knight Arts Foundation.

## April 2021

Self-Doubting System - new work commissioned for the online exhibit [Generative Unfoldings](https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu/) by the MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology

[facsimiles](https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/album/facsimiles) is an album of generated music created on modular synth and code (monome teletype), inspired by a 1970s Triadex Muse machine and the first chat bot I ever interacted with (Alfie) on a public MUSH on the internet in the mid 90s. *[additional info](https://leetusman.com/algoraves/2021-04-15-triadex-muse.html)*

[Slimey](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/blob/master/contrib/themes/README.md) is a theme I contributed for the Amfora Gemini client

## March 2021

[Gobi](https://notapipe.itch.io/gobi) is a minimal desert adventure game in the lineage of early strategy games like The Oregon Trail. It is based on my memories of a shareware game I used to play on my Mac System 7 in the mid-90s, a game that came on a CD-Rom with 100 other games. *[additional info/code](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gobi)

[Dungeon of the Day](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/dungeon-of-the-day) / Embarassed Cake Watering Hole *(working title)* is an (incomplete) entry to the 7drl / seven day roguelike challenge 2021 and still in progress: [devlog](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/dungeon-of-the-day)

## February 2021

[List of Games I'd Like to Play and/or Make](https://notapipe.itch.io/games-id-like-to-play-andor-make) for [List Jam](https://itch.io/jam/list-jam)

Created [Geminut](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp), a Gemini protocol to HTML and Markdown converter for translating a gemlog to a blog, website, documentation, etc

I created an implementation of the turtle-drawing LOGO programming language called [PLOGO](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/PLOGO) that I made in p5.js. It includes a retro mode and onscreen console log of the input file.

### Art Homepage Fair

IPDW, working with Arebyte AOS has organized an online art homepage fair. I built [collapsed texts](https://arthomepagefair.net/~lee/), an interactive experimental artwork and log that I am updating throughout the month.

## January 2021

### Obscure Instructions MOTD

In the spring I created a web-based Obscure Instructions program, an homage to Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno / Peter Schmidt. [Obscure Instructions MOTD](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/obscure-instructions-motd) is a command line "Message of the Day" node program to display one randomly as a "welcome" message.

### LeeSD Dream Emulator

Started coding generative sketches of my dreams. An homage to LSD Dream Emulator, which I'm waiting to actually try playing until after I code my own. I've started with a few generative dream sketches: [1](https://leetusman.com/everyday/161/) [2](https://leetusman.com/everyday/163/)

## December 2020

I created a generative self-playing project called Self-Doubting Systems for MIT [Center for Art, Science and Technology](https://arts.mit.edu/cast/). It will be featured in an online exhibition and printed book.

## November 2020

I contributed two (very) short tabletop roleplaying games to the [Micro Fiction Games Jam](https://microfictiongames.neocities.org/2020/)
I've created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing Machines in. So far it's resulted in a number of [albums](https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/) on Bandcamp but I hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I wrote a [post](https://leetusman.com/nosebook/programing-patching) on my Nosebook about it.

I'm a professor of New Media and Computer Science at [Purchase College](https://www.purchase.edu/live/profiles/2060-lee-tusman). 

[Babycastles](https://www.babycastles.com) is a 10+ year NYC based collective fostering and amplifying diverse voices in videogame culture. We've held 25+ workshops so far since the start of the pandemic. Topics: livecoding, game design, goal-setting, writing grants, protester safety, and more.
