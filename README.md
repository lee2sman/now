### Teaching

I'm a professor of New Media and Computer Science at Purchase College.

### [Artists and Hackers](https://artistsandhackers.org)

A [podcast](https://www.artistsandhackers.org) that I'm hosting.

### ExquisiteCorp: generative music systems

I've created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing Machines in. So far it's resulted in a number of [albums](https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/) on Bandcamp but I hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I wrote a [post](https://leetusman.com/nosebook/programing-patching) on my Nosebook about it.

### Babycastles 

I'm a member of the Babycastles organizing collective that helps run the space and put together public programs.  I organize the Babycastles Academy workshops: low-cost or free online workshops on a variety of topics of interest to our community. We've held 25+ workshops so far since the start of the pandemic. Topics: livecoding, game design, goal-setting, writing grants, protester safety, and more.  [Video archive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJzpMnmDTJIUBNOpzI5qdPJ1cXhITBSq-) [Notes](https://github.com/babycastles/Babycastles-Academy). Received a grant from the NYC Dep't of Cultural Affairs. I also help organize the collective and community, and co-organized our new - - - in - Residency Program supported by Max Neely-Cohen.

### Geminut

Created [Geminut](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp), a Gemini protocol to HTML and Markdown converter for translating a gemlog to a blog, website, documentation, etc

### PLOGO

I created an implementation of the turtle-drawing LOGO programming language called [PLOGO](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/PLOGO) that I made in p5.js. It includes a retro mode and onscreen console log of the input file.

### Art Homepage Fair

IPDW, working with Arebyte AOS has organized an online art homepage fair. I built [collapsed texts](https://arthomepagefair.net/~lee/), an interactive experimental artwork and log that I am updating throughout the month.

## January 2021

### Obscure Instructions MOTD

In the spring I created a web-based Obscure Instructions program, an homage to Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno / Peter Schmidt. [Obscure Instructions MOTD](https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/obscure-instructions-motd) is a command line "Message of the Day" node program to display one randomly as a "welcome" message.

### [LeeSD Dream Emulator](LeeSD-Dream-Emulator/)

Started coding generative sketches of my dreams. An homage to LSD Dream Emulator, which I'm waiting to actually try playing until after I code my own. I've started with a few dream sketches: [1](https://leetusman.com/everyday/161/) [2](https://leetusman.com/everyday/163/)

## December 2020

#### Generative Unfoldings

I created a generative self-playing project called Self-Doubting Systems for MIT [Center for Art, Science and Technology](https://arts.mit.edu/cast/). It will be featured in an online exhibition and printed book.

## November 2020

I contributed two (very) short tabletop roleplaying games to the [Micro Fiction Games Jam](https://microfictiongames.neocities.org/2020/).
