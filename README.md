#### [Artists and Hackers](https://artistsandhackers.org)

A [podcast](https://www.artistsandhackers.org) that I'm hosting.

#### ExquisiteCorp: generative music systems

I've created an esoteric modular synth setup for generative music creation, including a Teletype terminal that I code modular Turing Machines in. So far it's resulted in a number of [albums](https://exquisitecorp.bandcamp.com/) on Bandcamp but I hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I wrote a [post](https://leetusman.com/nosebook/programing-patching) on my Nosebook about it.

#### Babycastles Academy

I organize the Babycastles Academy workshops: low-cost or free online workshops on a variety of topics of interest to our community. We've held 22 workshops so far since the start of the pandemic. Topics: livecoding, game design, goal-setting, writing grants, protester safety, and more.

#### [LeeSD Dream Emulator](LeeSD-Dream-Emulator/)

Started coding generative sketches of my dreams. An homage to LSD Dream Emulator, which I'm waiting to actually try playing until after I code my own. I've started with a few dream sketches: [1](https://leetusman.com/everyday/161/) [2](https://leetusman.com/everyday/163/)

## December 2020

#### Generative Unfoldings

I created a generative self-playing project called Self-Doubting Systems for MIT [Center for Art, Science and Technology](https://arts.mit.edu/cast/). It will be featured in an online exhibition and printed book.

## November 2020

I contributed two (very) short tabletop roleplaying games to the [Micro Fiction Games Jam](https://microfictiongames.neocities.org/2020/).
